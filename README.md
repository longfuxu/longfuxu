<h1 align="center">ðŸ˜Ž Hi! I'm Longfu Xu</h1>

## About Me
I am a **biophysical and biochemical researcher**, dedicated to unraveling life's secrets at the molecular level. My focus is not on mere phenomena, but on understanding the fundamental laws set by the creator, guiding life's emergence and growth. My vision is to uncover these rules and hopefully construct a functional cell (or other life forms) from the ground up, revealing life's essence through each discovery.

I am currently working as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Professor Gijs Wuite's laboratory at **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**. My primary focus is on exploring the intricate dance between DNA and proteins during DNA replication. I employ cutting-edge single-molecule manipulation and visualization techniques, aiming to decode these vital interactions.
### Future Role
I will be starting a new journey as a postdoc researcher in Prof. **Carlos Bustamante**'s laboratory at **University of California, Berkeley** from Feb.2024. 

### Academic Education
- **Ph.D.**: Earned from the **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam** under the supervision of **Prof. Gijs Wuite**. I have using single-molecule techniques, such as Optical Tweezer and Fluorescence Microscopy to study DNA and protein interaction during DNA replicaiton process.
- **Master of Science**: Earned from the **University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences**, under **Professors Zhiguo Su** and **Yongdong Liu**, focusing on the field of long-acting biopharmaceuticals. My research centered on innovative methods like PEGylation and the incorporation of albumin-binding domains to a fused protein.

### Research Interests
- Single-Molecule Biophysics
- DNA-Protein Interactions
- Single-Molecule Manipulation& Visualization
- DNA Packaging
- Biopharmaceuticals
