## About Me
I am a **biophysicist** interested in decoding viral life cycles‚Äîespecially viral DNA replication and DNA packaging‚Äîfrom a single-molecule perspective. My goal is to deepen our understanding of these fundamental processes and potentially open new pathways for treating genetic diseases and preventing potential future viral threats.

## Current Research
I currently work as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Professor [Carlos Bustamante‚Äôs laboratory](http://bustamante.berkeley.edu) at **UC Berkeley**. My work focuses on a virally encoded molecular motor that packages the viral genome into a preassembled container. By investigating how these packaging machines harness ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release to generate mechanical force, we aim to shed light on the intricacies of viral assembly and function.

## Previous Academic Training
Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I pursued my PhD and postdoctoral research in Professor [Gijs Wuite‚Äôs laboratory](https://www.gijswuite.com) at the **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**. Employing advanced single-molecule techniques, we revisited fundamental DNA replication mechanisms using a simplified bacteriophage T7 system. One key finding revealed that replication is more dynamic than previously believed, prompting us to propose a ‚Äúdecentralized model,‚Äù as detailed in our recent [Nature Communications publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49612-3).

## Early Experiences
My **Master of Science** degree was obtained at the **University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences**, under the guidence of **Professors Zhiguo Su** and **Yongdong Liu**. During this period, my research centered on novel approaches to long-acting biopharmaceuticals, including PEGylation and albumin-binding domain fusion, aimed at enhancing therapeutic efficacy.
